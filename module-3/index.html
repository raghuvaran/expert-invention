  			<p>Okay so let's continue building out the site. As a quick review here where we are so far we have the logo the name of the restaurant and this kosher certified sign and we have the logo disappearing when we squeeze the browser to be a little bit smaller right around I think medium. I think below medium right. So medium and large the logo will show up, but the second it becomes less than medium and that is small the logo will disappear. So the next thing we want to do actually is let's go back to our design document and before we start coding the menu buttons that will show up in the header, these menu, about, awards, and so on. Let's go ahead and try to take care of the mobile view of our site where those menu items will not be there and they'll be collapsed and what will be here is this button right here that will let us open up the navigation and choose one of the menu items. And the reason I want to jump straight to this is because our navbar header kind of includes everything that will be in the mobile view. So I want to kind of take care of it right now since we already took care of these couple of things, I want to take care of this as well so then we'll be on our way. Okay, so before we code it, let's take a glance at the bootstrap documentation and the bootstrap documentation is really actually right here and for us to really see that button, we would have to squeeze the browser ourselves. Let's squeeze about here and let's going to refresh it again to go to menu, or to the nav bar. And when we scroll down, we'll see that's the same examples in all those menu now. All those menu items are now below and when you click, they kind of show up. And here's the code that shows you the code in order to achieve that same effect. So we're going to go ahead and do that in our code. Let's put the browser back to the max and we'll refresh that here, we already have our browser sync started so what we need to do here is I have some code that I prepared and we need to paste is right in here where it would be inside the navbar header.</p>
